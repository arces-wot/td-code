# TD-code

TD-code is a simple vscode extension that adds W3C Thing Description JSONSchema and some code snippets for `td.json` and `td.jsonld` files.

## Features

For each file with `td.json` or `td.jsonld` extension you will get intellisense code completion base on a modified version of the JSONSchema provided in the [W3C Thing Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/#json-schema-for-validation) specification page. VSCode will also validate your Thing Description following the rules described in the schema.  

For example, in this animation you can see the code completion in action:
